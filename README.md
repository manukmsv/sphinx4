# sphinx4
Sphinx4 is a pure Java speech recognition library. It provides a quick and easy API to convert the speech recordings into text with the help of CMUSphinx acoustic models. It can be used on servers and in desktop applications. Besides speech recognition, Sphinx4 helps to identify speakers, to adapt models, to align existing transcription to audio for timestamping and more.

Demos
A number of sample demos are included in the sphinx4 sources in order to give you an understanding how to run sphinx4. You can run them from the sphinx4-samples jar:

Transcriber - demonstrates how to transcribe a file
Dialog - demonstrates how to lead a dialog with a user
SpeakerID - speaker identification
Aligner - demonstration of audio to transcription timestamping
